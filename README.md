audit CARF demo

Toy with mechanism to create CARF data objects from given json string(s) in a generic way

Tasks yet to be considered include 
- how to handle a manifest (just using a hand generated set of items)
- how to apply formatting
- where to exclude a detail if it is unchanged (who/what decides)
- dependency injection
- other options for a detail provider
